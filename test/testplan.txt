This is a list of tests identified that need to be added for exhaustive testing.

DRAG BASIC
// 1a. Tests that go Up
// 1b. Tests that move Down, 
// 1c. Tests that move Left
// 1d. Tests that move Right

// 2a. Tests that go Up + Left
// 2b. Tests that go Up + Right
// 2c. Tests that go Down + Left
// 2d. Tests that go Down + Right

// 3a. Drag (Not just move) for PointerEvents
// 3b. Drag (Not just move) for TouchEvents

DRAG OFF SCREEN
// 4a. Edge cases: Drag off-screen
// 4b. Drag off page(?) << What was meant by this? (drag between iframes?)

DRAG OVER TIME
// 6a. Drag over time (Drag with duration)

DRAG TOO FAR
// Modify test pages to make sure that the drag doesn't go past the expect location

NOTES TO EXPAND ROBUSTNESS OF EXISTING TESTS
// 5a. Note: Ensure that no moves are sent past the drag cutoff (accurately)


MOVE BASIC
// 1a. Tests that go Up
// 1b. Tests that move Down, 
// 1c. Tests that move Left
// 1d. Tests that move Right

// 2a. Tests that go Up + Left
// 2b. Tests that go Up + Right
// 2c. Tests that go Down + Left
// 2d. Tests that go Down + Right

// 3a. Move for PointerEvents
// 3b. Move for TouchEvents

MOVE OFF SCREEN
// 4a. Edge cases: Move to off-screen element
// 4b. Move off page(?) << What was meant by this?

MOVE OVER TIME
// 6a. Move over time Move with duration)

DRAG TOO FAR
// Modify test pages to make sure that the move doesn't go past the expect location

NOTES TO EXPAND ROBUSTNESS OF EXISTING TESTS
// 5a. Note: Mouse moves should not be in the drag test
